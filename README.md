# Hey there,

> RIP. Chrome Extensions are no more. Sad day :(

This is just a simple chrome extension to block all promoted content on twitter. Most ad blockers have a lot of over head and I just wanted a little something light and spacific to what I need

## Files in project
* block.js
  * This file does the actual blocking of promoted content.
* inBackground.js
  * This file is the chrome extension that is running in the background waiting for the user to visit "twitter.com".
* jquery-2.0.2.min.js
  * This file allows me to use the cool stuff packed in jQuery so I dont have to fiddle with the javascript DOM selectors.
* manifest.json
  * This file is here because all Chrome apps have to have a manifest file :).

I know this is not perfect but hey it is my first Chrome extension :)
