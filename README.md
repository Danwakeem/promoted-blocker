#Hey there,

This is just a simple chrome extension to block all promoted content on twitter. Most ad blockers have a lot of over head and I just wanted a little something light and spacific to what I need

## Files in project
** block.js
*  This file does the actual blocking of promoted content.
** inBackground.js
*  This file is the chrome extension that is running in the background waiting for the user to visit "twitter.com".
** jquery-2.0.2.min.js
*  This file allows me to use the cool stuff packed in jQuery so I dont have to fiddle with the javascript DOM selectors.
** manifest.json
*  This file is here because all Chrome apps have to have a manifest file :).

I know this is not perfect but hey it is my first Chrome extension :)
